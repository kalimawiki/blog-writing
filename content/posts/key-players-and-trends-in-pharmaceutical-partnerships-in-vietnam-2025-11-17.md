Their strategic partnerships often enable the transfer of advanced manufacturing technologies, improve quality standards, and expand the product portfolio to meet both local and regional demand.

Additionally, domestic companies are increasingly investing in their own R&D capabilities, often in collaboration with academic institutions, to reduce reliance on imports and enhance self-sufficiency.

### Foreign Investors and Multinational Pharma Companies: Catalysts of Growth

Vietnam’s pharmaceutical market has not gone unnoticed by global players. Multinational corporations such as Pfizer, Sanofi, Novartis, and GlaxoSmithKline have actively engaged in Vietnam through partnerships, joint ventures, and direct investments.

Foreign investors bring robust capital, cutting-edge technologies, and global regulatory experience, all of which are pivotal for modernizing the local industry. Their investments often target the manufacturing of generic medicines, biosimilars, and even innovative drugs suited to Vietnam’s disease profile.

Partnerships with local players help these companies navigate Vietnam’s regulatory landscape, adapt to consumer preferences, and build distribution networks needed for market penetration. Collaborations also extend into clinical research, with Vietnam emerging as a preferred location for clinical trials due to its diverse patient pool and growing medical infrastructure.
