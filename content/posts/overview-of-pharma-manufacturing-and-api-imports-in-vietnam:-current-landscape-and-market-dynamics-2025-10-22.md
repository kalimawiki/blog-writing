Despite these advancements, local production of complex APIs remains limited due to high capital costs, technical barriers, and a shortage of highly specialized talent, keeping Vietnam reliant on imports.

## Role and Importance of API Imports in Vietnam

### What Are APIs?

APIs constitute the active component of a pharmaceutical drug responsible for treating a condition or disease. They are chemically synthesized or biologically derived substances that determine the effectiveness of the medication. Each API must meet rigorous quality and purity standards to ensure consistent drug safety and efficacy.

### Vietnam’s API Import Dependency

Currently, Vietnam imports an estimated 90-95% of the APIs used by its pharmaceutical industry. This dependency stems from limited local production capacity, with only a handful of factories producing basic APIs for local consumption. The vast majority of APIs are sourced from international suppliers, primarily from China and India, recognized as the world’s largest API producers due to their economies of scale, competitive pricing, and established chemical manufacturing ecosystems.

Other countries in Europe and the US also supply certain high-value or specialty APIs, though at a smaller volume compared to Asian suppliers.

### Implications of Import Reliance

While relying on API imports facilitates access to a broad spectrum of raw materials necessary to manufacture diverse pharmaceutical products, it also brings risks and challenges:

- **Supply Chain Vulnerability:** Disruptions in supplier countries caused by geopolitical tensions, trade barriers, or pandemics can lead to API shortages.

- **Quality Control Challenges:** Ensuring consistent API quality across multiple sourcing countries requires stringent inspection and verification by Vietnamese importers and regulators.

- **Cost and Price Sensitivity:** Fluctuations in supplier prices, tariffs, and freight costs impact manufacturing margins and ultimately medicine affordability in Vietnam.

### Efforts Toward Local API Production

Vietnamese policymakers and industry leaders acknowledge the strategic importance of developing domestic API manufacturing capabilities to reduce reliance on imports.
