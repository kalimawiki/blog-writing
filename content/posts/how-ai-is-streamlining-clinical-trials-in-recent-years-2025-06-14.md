### How AI Transforms Clinical Trials  

Clinical trials are the backbone of pharmaceutical development, but they're often plagued by delays, high costs, and inefficiencies. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is emerging as a game-changer, streamlining every phase of the processâ€”from patient recruitment to data analysis.  

#### Key AI Applications:  

1. **Patient Recruitment**  
   - AI algorithms analyze electronic health records (EHR) to identify eligible participants faster.  
   - Example: Natural Language Processing (NLP) scans physician notes for undiagnosed candidates.  

2. **Optimized Trial Design**  
   - Predictive modeling simulates trial outcomes, reducing costly protocol revisions.  

3. **Real-Time Monitoring**  
   - Wearables and AI detect adverse events early, improving patient safety.  

4. **Data Analysis Acceleration**  
   - Machine Learning processes complex datasets in hours, not months.  

### Challenges & Future Outlook  
While AI promises efficiency, challenges like data privacy and regulatory hurdles remain. However, with frameworks like FDA's AI/ML Software as a Medical Device (SaMD) evolving, the future is bright.
