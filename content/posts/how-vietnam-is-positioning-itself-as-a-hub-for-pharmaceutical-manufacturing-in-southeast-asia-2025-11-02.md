The government’s emphasis on STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) education and continuous training initiatives ensures that the workforce keeps pace with the fast-evolving pharmaceutical industry demands.

### Strong Government Incentives and Policy Support

Vietnam’s government has been proactive in crafting policies that foster pharmaceutical manufacturing growth, recognizing its value for national health and economic diversification. The National Strategy on Pharmaceutical Development (2021-2030) outlines goals to expand domestic pharmaceutical production capacity to meet about 80% of national demand by volume and roughly 70% of market value by 2030 ((Decision No.1165/QĐ-TTg and earlier Decision No.376/QĐ-TTg)).

Key incentives include:

- **Tax Breaks and Reductions:** Pharmaceutical manufacturers in designated industrial parks benefit from tax holidays for up to 4 years and reduced corporate tax rates thereafter.
- **Import Duty Exemptions:** Machinery and equipment imported for pharmaceutical manufacturing are often exempted from import duties, reducing capital expenditure costs.
- **Streamlined Regulatory Procedures:** Processes for issuing manufacturing licenses, clinical trial approvals, and drug registration have been accelerated, lowering time-to-market for products.
- **Investment in R&D:** Grants and subsidies support pharmaceutical research, paving the way for innovation in formulations and production technology.

On top of these, the government’s commitment to improving intellectual property protections strengthens confidence for foreign investments and technology transfers.

## Infrastructure Developments Supporting Pharma Manufacturing

### Development of Specialized Industrial Parks and Manufacturing Zones

Vietnam has prioritized the establishment of industrial clusters dedicated to pharmaceutical production. These clusters offer manufacturers ready-to-operate facilities that comply with international Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) and standards required by the WHO and FDA.

For instance, the Hoa Lac Hi-Tech Park near Hanoi is a flagship project focused on attracting high-tech and pharmaceutical manufacturing companies. It offers state-of-the-art utilities, waste treatment plants specialized for pharma effluents, and integrated logistics services.

Similarly, industrial zones in southern provinces (e.g., Nhon Hoi, Phu My clusters) are being promoted for high-tech pharma, biotech and supporting infrastructure.

These industrial parks foster ecosystem synergies—bringing raw material suppliers, manufacturers, logistics providers, and quality certifiers into close proximity. This clustering enhances operational efficiency and knowledge sharing among industry players.

### Enhanced Logistics and Supply Chain Infrastructure

Pharmaceutical manufacturing demands highly reliable and sophisticated logistics solutions, especially for managing APIs and finished products requiring precise storage conditions.

Vietnam is investing in modernizing its logistics infrastructure. Cold chain networks are being expanded to support temperature-controlled shipments, essential for biologics and vaccines. Several logistics firms are now offering end-to-end solutions ranging from refrigerated storage to last-mile delivery.

Expansion projects at key international airports like Tan Son Nhat in Ho Chi Minh City and Noi Bai in Hanoi are reducing air freight turnaround times, critical for the timely export and import of pharma products.
