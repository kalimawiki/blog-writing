## Introduction

When Japanese pharmaceutical giant Taisho wanted to crack Vietnam's booming healthcare market, it didn't build from the ground up—it bought its way to the top. By 2019, Taisho held a controlling stake in DHG Pharma, one of Vietnam's pharmaceutical champions, transforming both companies in the process. It's a pattern playing out across the country: foreign pharma giants and Vietnamese firms are joining forces in ways that are reshaping one of Southeast Asia's fastest-growing healthcare markets.

Vietnam's pharmaceutical market has exploded into a $7+ billion industry, fueled by 100 million consumers with rising incomes and growing healthcare needs. But here's the twist: the most successful players aren't going it alone. Instead, multinationals like Sanofi, STADA, and AstraZeneca are forming deep strategic partnerships with local companies—sharing risk, expertise, and billion-dollar infrastructure investments.

This isn't just about business deals. These joint ventures are:

- Bringing EU-standard manufacturing to Vietnam
- Producing 100 million vaccine doses annually for domestic use and export
- Accelerating market entry that would otherwise take years
- Creating pharmaceutical hubs that serve all of Southeast Asia

In this article, we examine real, documented partnerships that worked—revealing exactly how they were structured, why they succeeded, and what lessons they offer for anyone looking to enter or expand in Vietnam's pharmaceutical sector.

## Case Study 1: How Japan's Taisho Took Control of Vietnam's DHG Pharma—And Made It Work

**The Deal:** Between 2017 and 2019, Japanese pharmaceutical giant Taisho Pharmaceutical didn't just invest in Vietnam—it took over one of the country's largest drugmakers. By acquiring 51% of DHG Pharmaceutical JSC in April 2019, Taisho gained a controlling stake in a company with deep roots in Vietnam's generics and over-the-counter medicine markets.

This wasn't a typical merger. Taisho played the long game, gradually increasing its position over several years before crossing the 50% threshold. The result? DHG remained a Vietnamese-listed company with local brand recognition, but now operated with Japanese quality systems, capital backing, and strategic direction.

### Why This Partnership Made Sense

**For Taisho:**

* **Instant market access:** DHG's established distribution network reached hospitals, pharmacies, and clinics nationwide—infrastructure that would take a decade to build from scratch
* **Regional expansion base:** Vietnam positioned as a manufacturing hub for Taisho's broader Southeast Asian strategy
* **Lower risk entry:** Acquiring a proven company with cash flow beats starting a greenfield operation

**For DHG:**

* **Quality upgrade:** Access to Japanese GMP expertise and manufacturing standards
* **Capital injection:** Resources to modernize facilities and expand production capacity
* **Global network effect:** Alignment with Taisho opened doors to international markets and partnerships
* **Management evolution:** Governance and operational systems brought up to multinational standards

**The Results: Five Years Later**

The numbers tell the story. After five years under Taisho's control, DHG delivered compound annual net profit growth of 11%, with revenue growing at 4.7% annually.
But the real transformation went deeper than revenue growth. DHG shifted from competing primarily on price to building higher-value product lines. The company upgraded its brand positioning, streamlined operations, and strengthened its export capabilities—all while maintaining its Vietnamese identity in the domestic market.

### What Made It Work

This partnership succeeded because both sides brought complementary strengths and played to them:

1. **Patient capital approach** - Taisho spent years building trust and understanding the business before taking control
2. **Preserved local DNA** - DHG kept its Vietnamese management team, brand equity, and market relationships
3. **Clear value exchange** - Japanese quality systems + Vietnamese market knowledge = competitive advantage
4. **Aligned incentives** - Both parties benefited from profitable growth, not just market share grabs

### The Lesson for Market Entrants

Going slow can mean going fast. Taisho's gradual stake-building approach—controversial though it may have been initially—gave both companies time to align culture, systems, and strategy. By the time Taisho held majority control, the integration groundwork was already laid.

For foreign pharmaceutical companies eyeing Vietnam, the DHG-Taisho case demonstrates that acquiring an established player with strong distribution can be more effective than building from zero. For Vietnamese companies, it shows that partnering with the right foreign investor can accelerate growth without sacrificing local market position.

The key is finding alignment not just on financial terms, but on long-term vision and operational philosophy.

## Case Study 2: How a German Pharma Company Turned a Vietnamese Provincial Manufacturer Into an EU-Standard Powerhouse

**The Deal:** In 2018, German pharmaceutical giant STADA Arzneimittel saw potential where others saw risk—a generics manufacturer in Phu Yen province, far from Vietnam's commercial centers. STADA acquired 72% of Pymepharco JSC, calling it "an excellent basis for becoming a key leader in Vietnam." By 2020, STADA's stake hit 80%, with plans for full ownership.

What happened next transformed both companies and set a new benchmark for pharmaceutical partnerships in Vietnam.

### From Regional Player to International Standard

Most pharmaceutical partnerships in emerging markets focus on market access. STADA-Pymepharco went further: they rebuilt Pymepharco into a manufacturing platform that could compete globally.

**STADA's Vision:**

* **Regional production hub:** Use Pymepharco's facilities to manufacture high-quality generics for Vietnam and export markets
* **Cost advantage with quality:** Combine Vietnam's manufacturing efficiencies with German production standards
* **Existing relationships:** Leverage Pymepharco's established hospital and pharmacy networks
* **Trade gateway:** Position Vietnam as a springboard to ASEAN markets via free trade agreements

**Pymepharco's Transformation:**

* **Quality leap:** Upgrade from local GMP to EU-GMP certification—the gold standard that opens doors to European and premium Asian markets
* **Brand repositioning:** Become known for "German-quality medicines made in Vietnam"
* **Technology transfer:** Gain access to STADA's global manufacturing expertise and product portfolio
* **Export capacity:** Move beyond domestic market to become a regional supplier

**The Breakthrough: EU-GMP Certification**

By 2023, both of STADA Pymepharco's manufacturing plants in Tuy Hoa achieved EU Good Manufacturing Practice (EU-GMP) certification—a milestone few Vietnamese pharmaceutical companies have reached.

This wasn't just a regulatory checkbox. EU-GMP certification means:

* **Stringent quality standards** that meet or exceed requirements in European markets
* **Contract manufacturing opportunities** for multinational pharmaceutical companies
* **Premium positioning** in domestic hospital tenders and pharmacy procurement
* **Export eligibility** to markets that require EU-GMP for import approval

The certification transformed Pymepharco from a capable domestic manufacturer into a platform that could serve both local needs and international contracts.

**Beyond Manufacturing: Building a Distribution Ecosystem**

STADA Pymepharco didn't stop at production quality. The company expanded its reach through strategic distribution partnerships:

* **Trung Son Pharmacy:** National pharmacy chain partnership for retail distribution
* **Buymed:** Collaboration with Vietnam's leading health-tech platform for digital distribution and hospital access

This multi-channel strategy—combining EU-standard manufacturing with modern distribution—created a competitive moat that's difficult to replicate.

**The Impact: Five Years of Integration**

The STADA-Pymepharco partnership demonstrates what's possible when foreign capital meets local market knowledge and both sides commit to fundamental transformation:

* Two facilities upgraded to EU-GMP standard
* Expanded product portfolio with STADA's international generics
* Enhanced market access through pharmacy chain and digital partnerships
* Positioned as contract manufacturer for other multinational companies
* Brand equity in both domestic and regional markets

### What Made This Work

Four factors explain this partnership's success:

1. Ambitious but achievable goal - EU-GMP certification was challenging but had a clear path
2. Staged integration - STADA increased stake gradually while supporting operational upgrades
3. Investment beyond equity - Technology transfer, training, and quality systems mattered as much as capital
4. Market timing - Vietnam's push for pharmaceutical industry upgrading aligned with STADA's expansion strategy

### The Lesson for Market Entrants

Manufacturing excellence creates strategic optionality. STADA didn't just buy market share—they built a platform that could serve multiple purposes: domestic distribution, regional export, and contract manufacturing.

For foreign companies, Pymepharco proves that provincial Vietnamese manufacturers can become international-standard platforms with the right investment and expertise. The key is committing to genuine transformation, not just adding a foreign brand name.

For Vietnamese manufacturers, the lesson is clear: international certification opens doors that domestic-only standards can't. EU-GMP, WHO-GMP, or PIC/S certification may require significant investment, but they fundamentally change what markets you can serve and what partnerships you can attract.

The STADA-Pymepharco story shows that with aligned vision and sustained commitment, a regional generics manufacturer can become a competitive player on the global stage.

## Case Study 3: How Sanofi Spent a Decade Building Vietnam Into Its ASEAN Manufacturing Powerhouse

**The Long Game:** While some companies test the waters in Vietnam, French pharmaceutical giant Sanofi dove in headfirst—and kept diving. Over more than a decade, Sanofi has invested over $150 million across multiple manufacturing facilities, evolving from basic drug production to cutting-edge vaccine manufacturing. The result: Vietnam now anchors Sanofi's entire ASEAN manufacturing strategy.

This isn't one partnership—it's a strategic industrial commitment that has evolved through three major phases, each building on the last.

### Phase 1: The ASEAN Manufacturing Flagship (2013)

In 2013, Sanofi made a bold statement by investing $75 million in its third Vietnamese factory, located in Saigon Hi-Tech Park in Ho Chi Minh City. At the time, Sanofi called it its largest factory in ASEAN—a significant claim from a company with manufacturing across Southeast Asia.

**What made this strategic:**

* **Capacity at scale:** Designed to produce up to 150 million boxes of pharmaceuticals annually
* **Regional export hub:** Built not just for Vietnam's market but to serve all of ASEAN
* **Hi-tech positioning:** Location in Saigon Hi-Tech Park signaled commitment to advanced manufacturing
* **Long-term anchor:** Demonstrated Sanofi viewed Vietnam as central to regional operations, not peripheral

This wasn't a hedge bet—it was a flagship investment that positioned Vietnam as Sanofi's manufacturing center of gravity in Southeast Asia.

### Strategic Alliance with State-Owned Vinapharm (2017)

In 2017, Sanofi deepened its local roots by signing a strategic cooperation agreement with Vinapharm (Vietnam Pharmaceutical Corporation), the country's state-owned pharmaceutical giant.

The partnership structure:

* **Joint investment:** Vinapharm invested directly in Sanofi Vietnam, becoming an equity partner in the hi-tech park factory
* **Manufacturing collaboration:** Shared capabilities in high-standard drug production
* **Distribution synergy:** Combined Sanofi's products with Vinapharm's nationwide distribution network
* **Regulatory alignment:** Partnership with state entity smoothed government relations and regulatory pathways

**Why this mattered:** By partnering with a state-owned enterprise, Sanofi gained more than capital—it gained institutional backing, regulatory goodwill, and deeper market access. For Vinapharm, the partnership meant technology transfer and exposure to international manufacturing standards.

This move showed that Sanofi understood Vietnam's unique business landscape: strategic partnerships with state entities can unlock advantages that purely commercial deals cannot.

### Phase 3: The Vaccine Leap with VNVC (2025)

In 2025, Sanofi took its Vietnam commitment into biologics territory with the launch of a vaccine manufacturing facility in Long An province, developed in partnership with Vietnam Vaccine JSC (VNVC), one of the country's leading private healthcare providers.

The investment:

* **Initial capital:** VND 2 trillion (~$77 million)
* **Production capacity:** Up to 100 million vaccine doses annually when fully operational
* **Technology transfer:** Sanofi providing vaccine production technology to VNVC
* **Market scope:** Serving both domestic vaccination needs and regional export markets

What this represents: This isn't just another manufacturing deal—it's a transformation in what Vietnam can produce. Moving from tablets and injections to vaccines represents a major leap in technical sophistication, cold chain infrastructure, and regulatory capability.

The vaccine facility positions Vietnam as a biologics production hub, not just a generics manufacturer. In a post-pandemic world where vaccine security is a strategic priority, this partnership addresses both commercial and national healthcare objectives.

### The Evolution: From Tablets to Vaccines, Local to Regional

Sanofi's three-phase approach demonstrates masterful strategic layering:

* 2013: Build large-scale manufacturing capacity for established products
* 2017: Deepen local partnerships and institutional relationships
* 2025: Move up the value chain into biologics and vaccines

Each phase built trust, demonstrated commitment, and created the foundation for the next level of investment. By 2025, Sanofi wasn't just present in Vietnam—it had built an integrated manufacturing ecosystem spanning generics, therapeutics, and biologics.

**The Strategic Impact**

Sanofi's decade-long commitment has created multiple layers of value:

**For Sanofi:**

* **Manufacturing scale:** Combined capacity of 150M+ drug boxes and 100M vaccine doses
* **Cost efficiency:** Vietnam's competitive manufacturing costs with quality standards
* **ASEAN gateway:** Vietnam-based production serves entire Southeast Asian market
* **Regulatory platform:** Experience navigating Vietnamese regulations provides competitive advantage
* **Strategic resilience:** Diversified manufacturing reduces dependence on any single country

**For Vietnam:**

* **Technology transfer:** Access to advanced pharmaceutical and vaccine production technology
* **Industrial upgrading:** Movement up the value chain from basic generics to biologics
* **Healthcare security:** Domestic vaccine production capacity reduces import dependence
* **Employment and skills:** Thousands of jobs and training in advanced manufacturing
* **Export potential:** High-quality production facilities enable pharmaceutical exports

### What Made This Work

Sanofi's success in Vietnam stems from several strategic choices:

1. Long-term commitment over quick returns - Decade-plus investment horizon built trust and capability
2. Phased escalation - Each phase de-risked the next by proving execution capability
3. Partnership diversity - Worked with both state (Vinapharm) and private (VNVC) partners
4. Industrial policy alignment - Investments matched Vietnam's goals for pharmaceutical independence
5. Regional thinking - Positioned Vietnam as ASEAN hub, not just a domestic market

### The Lesson for Market Entrants

Industrial commitment beats market access plays. Sanofi didn't just enter Vietnam to sell products—it built Vietnam into a core part of its regional manufacturing infrastructure. That level of commitment created advantages (regulatory relationships, supply chain optimization, talent development) that competitors can't easily replicate.

For companies considering Vietnam, Sanofi's approach demonstrates that treating a market as strategic infrastructure rather than just a customer base can generate outsized returns. The initial capital requirement is higher, but the competitive moat is deeper.

For Vietnamese policymakers and companies, the lesson is equally important: sustained foreign investment follows when you can demonstrate capability, partnership, and alignment with long-term strategic goals. Sanofi kept investing because each phase proved Vietnam could deliver.

The Sanofi story isn't just about pharmaceuticals—it's a masterclass in how to build lasting industrial presence in an emerging market.

## Case Study 4: AstraZeneca's $90M Bet—Partnering Directly with Vietnam's Government to Fight Chronic Disease

**The Unconventional Play:** While most pharmaceutical companies pursue traditional joint ventures or acquisitions, AstraZeneca took a different path in Vietnam. In 2023, the British-Swedish pharma giant signed a Memorandum of Understanding directly with Vietnam's Ministry of Health—committing up to VND 2 trillion ($90 million USD) through 2030 to build domestic manufacturing capacity while tackling the country's growing chronic disease burden.

This isn't an equity deal, a factory acquisition, or a licensing agreement. It's a public-private partnership that blends commercial objectives with public health outcomes—and it's reshaping how multinational pharmaceutical companies can engage with emerging market governments.

**Why This Model Is Different**

Traditional pharmaceutical partnerships focus on one thing: making and selling drugs. The AstraZeneca-Ministry of Health partnership takes a systems approach, addressing three interconnected goals simultaneously:

1. Domestic manufacturing - Producing three AstraZeneca medicines locally by 2030
2. Healthcare capacity building - Training healthcare workers and improving diagnostic pathways
3. Non-communicable disease (NCD) management - Strengthening prevention and treatment of cardiovascular, respiratory, and metabolic diseases

This model recognizes that pharmaceutical access isn't just about supply—it's about the entire healthcare ecosystem. You can manufacture medicines locally, but if doctors aren't trained to diagnose conditions early or hospitals lack proper screening equipment, patient outcomes won't improve.

**The Strategic Context: Vietnam's NCD Crisis**

Understanding why this partnership exists requires understanding the challenge Vietnam faces.

Vietnam is experiencing a *dramatic epidemiological transition*. As the country develops economically and lifestyles change, non-communicable diseases—heart disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory conditions—are becoming the dominant health burden:

* 73% of all deaths in Vietnam are now caused by NCDs
* Cardiovascular disease alone accounts for 33% of deaths
* Only a small fraction of patients with hypertension or diabetes are properly diagnosed and controlled
* Healthcare infrastructure built for infectious disease management isn't equipped for chronic disease care

For Vietnam's government, this is both a public health crisis and an economic threat—uncontrolled NCDs reduce workforce productivity and strain healthcare budgets. For AstraZeneca, a company with a strong portfolio in cardiovascular and respiratory medicines, it's a strategic opportunity to align commercial goals with national health priorities.

### The Partnership Framework

The 2023 MoU established a comprehensive five-year cooperation framework (2023-2028) built on three pillars:

**Pillar 1: Domestic Manufacturing**

* Investment commitment: VND 2 trillion (~$90M) between 2022-2030
* Goal: Local production of three key AstraZeneca medicines by 2030
* Approach: Supporting local manufacturing partners to upgrade facilities and capabilities rather than building AstraZeneca-owned factories
* Impact: Reduces medicine costs through local production and strengthens Vietnam's pharmaceutical self-sufficiency

**Pillar 2: Healthcare System Strengthening**

* Doctor and nurse training programs in NCD screening, diagnosis, and management
* Clinical pathway development for earlier detection and better treatment protocols
* Hospital capability upgrades through programs like "Green Energy for Health" (sustainable hospital operations)
* Telemedicine and digital health pilots to extend specialist expertise to rural areas

**Pillar 3: Prevention and Access Programs**

* Community screening initiatives to identify at-risk populations earlier
* Patient education campaigns on NCD risk factors and lifestyle management
* Affordability programs to improve access to essential medicines
* Data and analytics partnerships to track disease burden and intervention effectiveness

### What Each Side Brings to the Table

**AstraZeneca's Contributions:**

* **Capital:** $90M investment over eight years
* **Technical expertise:** Manufacturing technology transfer, clinical training, treatment protocols
* **Global best practices:** Lessons from NCD management programs in other countries
* **Product portfolio:** Access to innovative cardiovascular, respiratory, and metabolic medicines
* **Reputation:** Global brand credibility helps drive adoption of new standards

**Vietnam Ministry of Health's Contributions:**

* **Policy alignment:** Integrating partnership goals into national health strategies and hospital protocols
* **Regulatory facilitation:** Supporting domestic manufacturing approvals and quality standards
* **Healthcare network access:** Opening doors to public hospitals and provincial health departments
* **Data and insights:** Epidemiological data to target interventions effectively
* **Institutional legitimacy:** Government backing ensures sustainability and scale

**Early Progress and Implementation**

Though comprehensive outcome data won't be available until the partnership matures, early initiatives have launched:

* Hospital sustainability program: "Green Energy for Health" initiatives piloted in major hospitals to reduce environmental impact while cutting operational costs
* Manufacturing partner identification: AstraZeneca working with Vietnamese pharmaceutical companies to assess and upgrade facilities for local production
* Training programs: Healthcare worker education on cardiovascular and respiratory disease management
* Policy integration: NCD screening and management protocols being incorporated into national health guidelines

**The Strategic Innovation: Beyond Transactional Partnerships**

This partnership model represents a significant evolution in how pharmaceutical multinationals can engage emerging markets:

*Traditional Model:*

* Company builds or buys factory → produces drugs → sells to hospitals and pharmacies → success measured by revenue and market share

*AstraZeneca-MOH Model:*

* Company partners with government → co-invests in manufacturing AND healthcare capacity → improves disease detection and management → measures success by health outcomes AND commercial sustainability

The innovation is treating the healthcare system strengthening as part of the commercial strategy, not separate corporate social responsibility. When doctors can diagnose diseases earlier and hospitals have proper treatment protocols, demand for effective medicines increases organically—it's not just pushed through sales and marketing.

### What Makes This Work

Several factors enable this unconventional partnership model:

1. Aligned incentives: Vietnam needs NCD solutions; AstraZeneca has NCD products—clear mutual benefit
2. Long time horizon: 8-year commitment (2022-2030) allows for system-level change, not quick wins
3. Comprehensive approach: Addressing manufacturing, capacity, and access simultaneously creates compound effects
4. Measurable outcomes: Both health metrics (diagnosis rates, treatment adherence) and commercial metrics (local production, market access) can be tracked
5. Government commitment: Ministry of Health involvement ensures policy support and sustainability
6. Corporate strategy fit: AstraZeneca's focus on sustainability and health access aligns with partnership goals

### The Lesson for Market Entrants

Public-private partnerships can create advantages that equity stakes cannot. By partnering directly with the Ministry of Health, AstraZeneca gained:

* Policy alignment that competitors can't easily replicate
* Institutional relationships at the highest levels
* Social license to operate that strengthens brand and market position
* Insights into national health priorities that inform product strategy
* Long-term stability backed by government commitment

For companies entering Vietnam (or similar markets), the AstraZeneca model demonstrates that aligning commercial goals with government health priorities can be more powerful than traditional joint ventures—especially in therapeutic areas where public health needs are acute.

For governments, this partnership shows that sophisticated companies are willing to invest in healthcare system capacity, not just supply chains, when presented with clear frameworks and long-term collaboration opportunities.

The key is finding authentic alignment between what the company does best and what the country needs most—then structuring a partnership that creates shared value, not just commercial transactions.

**The Broader Implication**

The AstraZeneca-Ministry of Health partnership may represent the future of pharmaceutical market entry in middle-income countries.

As nations like Vietnam move beyond basic healthcare infrastructure toward managing chronic diseases and complex conditions, partnerships that build healthcare system capacity will become more valuable than partnerships that simply add manufacturing capacity.

Companies that can demonstrate they're partners in health outcomes, not just suppliers of products, will earn preferential access, policy support, and social trust that competitors struggle to match.

## Challenges That Still Need to Be Managed

Even the most successful partnerships in Vietnam hit familiar roadblocks. These aren’t deal-breakers, but they are make-or-break factors for newcomers who underestimate them.

* **Regulatory complexity:** Policies improve every year, but rules shift fast and approvals can be unpredictable. Staying compliant requires ongoing vigilance.
* **IP and data concerns:** As Vietnam moves into biologics and R&D-heavy projects, protecting intellectual property becomes a crucial negotiation point.
* **Talent shortages:** Expertise in GMP, regulatory affairs, and biologics manufacturing remains limited, pushing partners to invest heavily in training.
* **Supply chain reliance:** Dependence on imported APIs and uneven logistics infrastructure can slow production and raise costs.

The partnerships that thrive are the ones that proactively invest in talent, quality systems, and strong regulatory relationships.

## Conclusion

Vietnam’s pharmaceutical market isn’t just growing—it’s being actively reshaped by partnerships that blend global expertise with local strength. The stories of Taisho, STADA, Sanofi, and AstraZeneca show a clear pattern: the companies that win in Vietnam are those willing to think long-term, invest deeply, and align their goals with the country’s broader healthcare ambitions.

These collaborations have upgraded local manufacturing to EU-GMP standards, accelerated technology transfer, expanded access to life-saving medicines, and laid the groundwork for Vietnam to become a regional powerhouse in both generics and biologics.

For entrepreneurs and industry leaders, the message is simple but powerful:

* Partnerships must be strategic, not transactional.
* Long-term alignment beats short-term gains.
* Quality, capability-building, and shared value creation are the foundations of success.

As Vietnam continues its push toward pharmaceutical self-sufficiency and regional leadership, joint ventures and public–private collaborations will remain the engine behind that transformation. The opportunities are expanding—but they will belong to the companies that understand Vietnam not just as a market, but as a partner.
