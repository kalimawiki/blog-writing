## Introduction

In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) has gradually become a ‚Äúpowerful assistant‚Äù in pharmaceutical research. Thanks to its ability to rapidly analyze, learn from massive data sets, and even ‚Äúcreate‚Äù new ideas, AI is helping scientists shorten drug development time ‚Äî from many years down to just a few months.

From understanding molecular structures and predicting chemical properties to designing new drugs and simulating reactions in the body ‚Äî AI is assisting in nearly every stage of the research process. This article introduces outstanding AI tools that are widely used in drug development.

## 1. DeepChem & RDKit ‚Äì Open-source libraries that help computers understand molecules

In modern drug development research, simulating and predicting molecular properties using computers is a crucial step to save time and testing costs. Two prominent tools that support this are **DeepChem** and **RDKit** ‚Äì both are open-source libraries widely used by the scientific community.

**DeepChem ‚Äì Helping AI learn about molecules**

DeepChem is a software library that helps build AI models to analyze and predict the chemical or biological properties of molecules. With DeepChem, computers can:

- Predict toxicity, absorption, and solubility of molecules;

- Analyze molecular structures as ‚Äúgraphs‚Äù (imagine a network of atoms connected together);

- Learn from large research datasets to improve model accuracy.

Thanks to DeepChem, researchers can quickly assess whether a molecule has potential as a drug ‚Äî without needing to run lab tests right away.

**RDKit ‚Äì The computer‚Äôs ‚Äúchemical language processor‚Äù**

RDKit is a powerful tool that helps computers understand chemical structures. If molecules are considered the unique language of chemistry, then RDKit is the ‚Äúdictionary‚Äù and ‚Äútranslator‚Äù that helps computers read, interpret, and analyze that language.

With RDKit, researchers can:

- Model molecular structures from SMILES strings (a compact way to describe molecules);

- Calculate properties such as molecular weight, polarity, solubility, etc.;

- Compare and search for similar molecules, aiding in screening potential compounds.

**ü§ù A powerful combination**

In many research projects, RDKit is often used to process and ‚Äúunderstand‚Äù molecular data, while DeepChem applies AI to deeply analyze or predict key properties. This combination creates an efficient pipeline ‚Äî from data input to decision-making ‚Äî that accelerates the development of new drugs.

## 2. ChemBERTa & SMILES Transformer ‚Äì When AI ‚Äúreads‚Äù molecular structures like a language

When humans look at a molecular string, such as a SMILES sequence (a shorthand for chemical structures), it can be hard to visualize what it means. But with modern AI, current models can **‚Äúread‚Äù these sequences** like reading a paragraph, extracting important insights about the molecule‚Äôs properties and activities.

**ChemBERTa ‚Äì Teaching AI to ‚Äúread‚Äù molecules like reading a book** 

ChemBERTa is based on the BERT model ‚Äì a well-known AI used in natural language processing for tasks like translation, content writing, and question answering. Instead of reading English or Vietnamese, **ChemBERTa is ‚Äútrained‚Äù to read molecular sequences in SMILES format**.

After extensive training, ChemBERTa can:

- Predict whether a molecule is toxic;
 
- Understand how a molecule might interact with proteins in the body;

- Classify molecules by their biological activity profiles.

In other words, ChemBERTa allows researchers to ‚Äúcommunicate‚Äù with molecules through computational language and uncover their hidden properties.

**SMILES Transformer ‚Äì Translating molecular strings into deep insights** 

SMILES Transformer is also an AI model trained on SMILES strings but is designed specifically to **encode molecular information into deeper digital representations** ‚Äì called ‚Äúembeddings.‚Äù These representations not only summarize structural information but also **indicate how the molecule might behave in a biological environment**.

This model is especially useful for applications like:

- Designing new molecules structurally similar to known ones;

- Rapid screening of compounds with high pharmacological potential;

- Integrating with other AI models to predict drug efficacy.

**üí° Why does this matter?**

In the past, understanding how a molecule works required lab experiments ‚Äî a costly and time-consuming process. Now, thanks to models like ChemBERTa and SMILES Transformer, computers can ‚Äúunderstand‚Äù molecules just by reading their symbols and suggest the most promising development directions.

## 3. GraphConv ‚Äì When AI views molecules as ‚Äúconnection maps‚Äù

In chemistry, a molecule is not just a group of atoms ‚Äî it‚Äôs a *network of tightly connected atoms and chemical bonds*. To help computers understand this structure, scientists have developed a special method called Graph Neural Networks ‚Äì neural networks that process graph-structured data.

One prominent model of this type is **GraphConv**.

**GraphConv ‚Äì Teaching AI to understand molecules like reading a diagram**

Imagine each atom in a molecule as a node and each bond as an edge. The whole molecule then resembles a mini network diagram. **GraphConv is designed to ‚Äúread‚Äù these networks and extract features based on how atoms are connected**.

With this ability, GraphConv can help:

- Predict toxicity, water solubility, or protein binding capabilities;

- Compare differences between molecular structures;

- Discover molecules structurally similar to existing drugs but potentially more effective or with fewer side effects.

**Why is GraphConv effective?**

Compared to traditional models that rely on molecular strings (like SMILES), GraphConv **better leverages the ‚Äúshape‚Äù and ‚Äúconnectivity‚Äù of molecules**, enabling it to:

- Understand the overall impact of structure on biological properties;

- Detect small structural details that could affect drug performance.

**üöÄ Applications in drug development**

GraphConv is widely used in biotech companies to:

- Screen millions of molecules in just a few hours;

- Identify compounds that bind strongly to target proteins, aiding precision drug development;

- Cut research time from years to months.

GraphConv exemplifies how **machines can not only ‚Äúread‚Äù but also ‚Äúsee‚Äù chemical structures**, offering a completely new approach to drug development using AI.

## 4. AutoDock Vina ‚Äì Helping computers ‚Äúpredict‚Äù how drugs bind to proteins

In drug development, a key question is: *Will the drug molecule bind correctly to its target (protein) in the body*? Traditionally, answering this requires complex lab experiments.

However, with computational simulation technology ‚Äî called **molecular docking** ‚Äî we can **predict how drugs and proteins interact**. One of the most popular and powerful tools for this is **AutoDock Vina**.

**What is AutoDock Vina?**

AutoDock Vina is an open-source software developed to **simulate how a small molecule (like a drug) binds to a larger molecule (usually a protein)**. It uses optimization algorithms to determine:

- The most suitable binding site on the protein;

- How the molecule ‚Äútwists and bends‚Äù to fit that site;

- The binding affinity ‚Äî a key factor in drug effectiveness.

**Outstanding advantages**

- **ast and accurate:** AutoDock Vina can screen thousands of molecules quickly and efficiently;

- **User-friendly and globally popular:** Used by hundreds of labs and pharmaceutical companies worldwide;

- **Free and open-source:** Anyone can download, use, and integrate it into their research.

**üß™ Real-world application**

AutoDock Vina is commonly used in the preclinical stage to:

- Identify potential drug candidates;

- Eliminate non-viable compounds early, saving testing costs;

- Understand drug mechanisms at the molecular level, helping improve drug design.

With AutoDock Vina, **computers can serve as a ‚Äúvirtual lab‚Äù**, allowing scientists to test ideas much faster than traditional methods ‚Äî paving the way for more effective drugs to be developed faster.

## 5. Schr√∂dinger Suite ‚Äì A ‚Äúvirtual laboratory‚Äù toolkit for drug design

In drug development, understanding how a molecule interacts with the body ‚Äî such as *binding to proteins, moving through the bloodstream, or causing side effects* ‚Äî is critically important. However, performing all these analyses through traditional lab methods is time-consuming and costly.

That‚Äôs why pharmaceutical companies now use **Schr√∂dinger Suite** ‚Äî a powerful software suite that enables **simulation, analysis, and drug design entirely via computers**.

**What is Schr√∂dinger Suite?**

Schr√∂dinger Suite is a collection of computational science software designed to:

- Simulate molecular structures at the atomic level;

- Predict how molecules interact with proteins in the body;

- Calculate important properties such as solubility, stability, and binding affinity to biological targets.

In other words, it‚Äôs a **comprehensive ‚Äúvirtual lab‚Äù** where researchers can test ideas, modify molecular structures, and evaluate effectiveness ‚Äî all without test tubes or microscopes.

**Key tools in Schr√∂dinger Suite**

- **Maestro:** The main interface that allows users to visualize and manipulate 3D molecular structures.

- **Glide:** Simulates how molecules dock with proteins ‚Äî similar to AutoDock Vina but with much higher accuracy.

- **Desmond:** Simulates molecular dynamics ‚Äî i.e., molecules ‚Äúmoving‚Äù in a virtual environment as if real, helping analyze drug behavior over time.

- **QikProp:** Quickly predicts pharmacokinetic properties such as absorption, blood-brain barrier permeability, toxicity, etc.

**üöÄ Real-world applications**

Schr√∂dinger Suite is used by many major pharmaceutical companies worldwide to:

- Design new drug molecules before synthesizing them in the lab;

- Eliminate unsuitable compounds early, saving years of research and millions in cost;

- Optimize molecular structures to increase efficacy and reduce side effects.

With Schr√∂dinger Suite, **drug development becomes faster, smarter, and less risky**. It‚Äôs a clear example of how technology is shortening the path from lab to patient.

## 6. IBM RXN for Chemistry ‚Äì Predicting chemical reactions with AI

In chemistry, creating a new molecule (like a drug) requires synthesis ‚Äî *combining substances through a series of chemical reactions*. However, designing an efficient reaction sequence isn‚Äôt easy, and often requires many trial-and-error attempts in the lab.

That‚Äôs why IBM developed **IBM RXN for Chemistry** ‚Äî a platform that uses artificial intelligence (AI) to **predict chemical reactions**, helping researchers dramatically reduce time and effort in synthesizing new molecules.

**What is IBM RXN?**

IBM RXN is an online tool that uses deep learning models to:

- Predict the product of a chemical reaction ‚Äî if you mix A with B, the tool predicts what product C will be;

- Suggest synthesis pathways ‚Äî if you want to create molecule X, it suggests what starting materials to use and what steps to follow;

- Optimize the synthesis process, saving time, reagents, and cost.

**How does IBM RXN work?**

It works like a **‚ÄúGoogle Translate‚Äù for chemical reactions**. You simply enter the formula or names of the input compounds, and AI ‚Äútranslates‚Äù the output compound or the reaction path. It has been **trained on millions of real-world reactions from scientific literature**, allowing it to make accurate and chemically sound predictions.

**‚úÖ Benefits for pharmaceuticals**

In drug development, IBM RXN helps:

- Design shorter, more efficient synthesis pathways for potential drug compounds;

- Avoid ineffective or undesirable reactions, thereby increasing synthesis success rates;

- Save time on lab experiments, especially for complex molecules.

IBM RXN for Chemistry is a prime example of how AI can not only predict molecular properties but also support the very first step ‚Äî **creating those molecules more intelligently**. It‚Äôs a highly useful tool for chemists, especially in the pharmaceutical industry where time and precision are crucial.

## 7. scape-DB ‚Äì The ‚Äúfoundation‚Äù data warehouse for AI in drug research

Artificial intelligence (AI) can predict molecular properties, design new drugs, and simulate chemical reactions ‚Äî but to do all this, AI must be trained with data. Just like humans need books to learn, *AI needs large, high-quality datasets to understand the world of chemistry*.

That‚Äôs why researchers have built **scape-DB** ‚Äî a vast database designed specifically to train AI models in pharmaceuticals and computational chemistry.

**What is scape-DB?**

scape-DB is a **molecular data bank** containing millions of molecules and related information such as:

- Chemical structures;

- Physico-chemical properties (weight, solubility, polarity‚Ä¶);

- Biological activity (which diseases the molecule targets, which proteins it interacts with‚Ä¶).

This data is **standardized, organized, and easily accessible**, enabling AI models to learn faster and more effectively.

**Why is a database important?**

In AI, there's a principle: **‚Äúgarbage in, garbage out‚Äù** ‚Äî if training data is poor, the AI model, no matter how advanced, will produce inaccurate results. On the other hand, trained on rich, high-quality data like in scape-DB, AI can:

- Distinguish promising molecules from useless compounds;

- Understand the relationship between structure and activity;

- Learn to suggest new drug designs.

**üß¨ Role of scape-DB in drug development**

AI researchers in pharma use scape-DB as:

- A standard dataset for training AI models;

- A foundation for testing and comparing the accuracy of new algorithms;

- A starting point for building smart, computer-aided drug development pipelines.

In other words, scape-DB is like a **massive chemical library for AI**, forming the solid foundation for AI models to ‚Äúmature‚Äù and work effectively in the quest to discover new medicines for humanity.

## 8. GENTRL ‚Äì AI ‚Äúcreates‚Äù new drug molecules by learning through trial and error

One of the most important ‚Äî and challenging ‚Äî steps in drug development is *designing a completely new molecule* ‚Äî one that has never existed in nature ‚Äî but is capable of effectively treating disease. Traditionally, this takes years of trial and refinement in the lab.

However, with modern technology, **AI can now not only analyze and predict but also ‚Äúcreate‚Äù new molecules**. One of the pioneering tools enabling this is **GENTRL**.

**What is GENTRL?**

GENTRL (Generative Tensorial Reinforcement Learning) is an AI model developed to:

- Automatically generate entirely new drug molecules;

- Follow defined criteria like safety, efficacy, water solubility, good protein interaction‚Ä¶;

- Gradually optimize designs through reinforcement learning ‚Äî learning by trial and error.

Simply put, GENTRL acts like a **virtual molecular inventor** ‚Äî creating thousands of ideas, self-evaluating which ones are good, and continuing to improve the promising ones.

**How GENTRL works**

- Starts from known molecules (existing drugs, natural compounds‚Ä¶);

- Creates new variations using a molecular ‚Äúimagination‚Äù algorithm;

- Evaluates each molecule using helper AI models (e.g., measuring toxicity, protein binding‚Ä¶);

- Keeps the good ones, discards the poor ‚Äî like natural selection.

Through many such loops, GENTRL can produce novel, untested but highly promising molecules.

**üöÄ Real-world applications**

- GENTRL has been used to design a fibrosis treatment drug, with early tests showing very promising results ‚Äî all done in just a few weeks instead of years.
