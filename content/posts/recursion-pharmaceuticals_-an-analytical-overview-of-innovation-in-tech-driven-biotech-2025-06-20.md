## Introduction to Recursion Pharmaceuticals

Founded in 2013, Recursion Pharmaceuticals has quickly emerged as a pioneering force in the biotechnology sector by integrating artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies into drug discovery. Headquartered in Salt Lake City, Utah, Recursion utilizes vast biological and chemical datasets to accelerate the identification and development of novel therapeutics, with a particular focus on rare diseases as well as broader therapeutic areas.

Beginning as a tech-forward startup, Recursion has evolved into a significant biopharma company with diverse capabilities and a growing clinical pipeline. Their approach challenges traditional drug discovery paradigms, positioning them at the leading edge where biology, automation, and AI converge.

## About Recursion Pharmaceuticals

Recursion’s mission is succinct: decode biology to radically improve lives. Their core purpose revolves around transforming drug discovery via industrialized and automated biology at scale, harnessing both experimental and computational methods to reveal patterns and therapeutic candidates more rapidly and accurately than conventional methodologies.

The leadership team is central to driving this vision:

- **Chris Gibson, Ph.D.** – Co-founder and CEO. With backgrounds in engineering and biology, Gibson champions the innovative fusion of technology and life sciences to disrupt pharmaceutical R&D.

- **David Mauro, M.D, Ph.D.** – Chief Medical Officer. An expert in translational, preliminary, and later stages of drug development for more than 25 Investigational New Drug candidates over the past decade.

- **David Hallett, Ph.D.** – Chief Scientific Officer. Joined Recursion after serving for 5 years as the Chief Scientific Officer and Interim CEO of Exscientia.

## Prominent Technologies, Platforms, and Algorithms

Recursion’s competitive advantage springs from its sophisticated technology platform, which integrates experimental biology with advanced computational tools to revolutionize drug discovery:

- **Recursion Operating System (Recursion OS):** The Recursion Operating System (Recursion OS) is a proprietary platform that integrates large-scale robotic experimentation, multimodal data capture, and AI-powered analytics. It enables rapid, iterative cycles of biological discovery by automating experimental workflows and accelerating insight extraction across disease biology and pharmacology.

- **High-Content Imaging (HCI) and Phenotypic Screening:** Utilizing automated microscopy, Recursion captures detailed cellular images from thousands of biological assays. Advanced machine vision techniques analyze these images, creating multi-dimensional phenotypic profiles of disease models and drug responses.

- **LOWE:** an AI agent developed internally at Recursion. It leverages latent embeddings to model and interpret complex biological data, including cellular images. It helps detect subtle phenotypic effects of chemical compounds and supports predictions of therapeutic mechanisms and targets through advanced ML, including clustering, optimization, and hypothesis generation.

- **Deep Learning and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs):** Recursion employs deep convolutional neural networks trained on millions of high-content cellular images to extract quantitative phenotypic signatures—called phenoprints—across diverse disease models and experimental perturbations. These embeddings form the foundation of Recursion’s phenotypic profiling platform, enabling large-scale prediction of biological function and compound activity.

- **Multi-Modal Data Integration:** Recursion’s platform integrates multimodal data—including high-content imaging, genetic perturbations, transcriptomics, proteomics, and chemical structures—to train machine learning models that identify drug targets and uncover mechanisms of action with high precision.

- **Self-Improving AI Cycles:** Recursion’s platform is built around adaptive learning loops, where AI models continuously retrain on new experimental data. This self-improving cycle accelerates the identification of effective compounds and biological targets, improving predictive accuracy and discovery efficiency over time.

- **Automated Robotics and Lab Automation:** Recursion conducts over a million experiments per week using advanced lab automation—including robotic liquid handlers, sample processors, and high-content imaging systems. This industrial-scale platform gives Recursion one of the most automated and data-rich operations in biotech.

- **BioHive-2:** Recursion's next-generation, in-house supercomputer designed to power large-scale biological data processing and machine learning. Built in collaboration with NVIDIA as a DGX SuperPOD system and claimed to be the largest supercomputer in the pharmaceutical industry (May 2024), BioHive-2 delivers approximately four times the computational capacity of its predecessor, enabling Recursion to process petabytes of high-dimensional data from cellular imaging, omics, and chemical structures. This infrastructure supports the training of advanced AI models—including deep neural networks and multimodal agents—accelerating drug discovery by uncovering complex biological relationships at an unprecedented scale.

Together, these technologies create an end-to-end ecosystem, enabling extensive phenotypic screening powered by proprietary AI algorithms like LOWE, setting Recursion apart in the AI-driven drug discovery space.
