## Introduction

In recent years, Vietnam’s pharmaceutical industry has entered a period of rapid growth — both in scale and sophistication. The government’s long-term vision to position Vietnam as a regional pharmaceutical manufacturing hub has led to major regulatory reforms designed to align the sector with international standards.  

Central to this transformation are the new Ministry of Health (MOH) guidelines introduced between 2023 and 2025. These updates touch every aspect of the manufacturing ecosystem — from Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) compliance and drug registration to digital licensing systems, clinical trials, and pharmacovigilance frameworks.  

This article explores how these guidelines reshape the regulatory landscape, what they mean for manufacturers and investors, and how companies can adapt to remain competitive under stricter quality and compliance expectations.

## Vietnam’s Pharmaceutical Sector at a Glance

Vietnam’s pharmaceutical market is now among the most dynamic in Southeast Asia. The country’s population of more than 100 million and rising healthcare expenditures are driving a sustained rise in drug consumption.  

According to the Ministry of Industry and Trade, Vietnam’s pharma market was valued at around US $6–7 billion in 2023 and could exceed **US $10 billion by 2030** [[Vietnam News, 2024](https://vietnamnews.vn/economy/1656408/pharmaceutical-industry-sees-slowing-growth-momentum.html)]. Imports continue to supply the bulk of inputs: up to 80–90% of Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (APIs) are sourced from abroad, mostly from China and India [[Vietnam Credit, 2023](https://vietnamcredit.com.vn/news/vietnams-pharmaceutical-industry-challenges-and-opportunities-in-2023_14975)].  

At present, Vietnam has 288 licensed pharmaceutical manufacturing facilities, including both domestic and foreign-invested companies [[KPMG, 2025](https://assets.kpmg.com/content/dam/kpmg/vn/pdf/2025/10/future-value-of-vietnam-generics-market-eng.pdf)]. Many operate on older production lines but are rapidly upgrading to meet modern GMP and WHO standards.  

## Overview of the New MOH Guidelines (2023 – 2025)

Vietnam’s MOH, through the Drug Administration of Vietnam (DAV) and the Department of Science, Technology and Training, has introduced a series of updates that collectively modernize the country’s pharmaceutical regulatory framework.  

### 1. Strengthened GMP and Quality Compliance

Under **Circular No. 03/2023/TT-BYT**, effective from late 2023, all domestic manufacturers must comply with Vietnam GMP (VGMP) aligned with the WHO-GMP and PIC/S-GMP standards. The new requirements emphasize:

- Digitalized batch records and traceability.  
- Enhanced environmental controls and clean-room classifications.  
- Routine quality-risk management documentation.  
- Expanded validation protocols for APIs, excipients, and packaging materials.  

Manufacturers that fail to obtain updated GMP certificates risk suspension of manufacturing licenses or exclusion from public-procurement lists [[DAV, 2024](https://drugadministration.gov.vn)].  

### 2. Faster Drug Registration and E-Licensing

The **Circular No. 08/2022/TT-BYT** and subsequent 2024 updates introduced a centralized e-submission system for drug registration and import licensing. The DAV’s new portal allows online dossier submission, document tracking, and digital signatures — reducing administrative processing times by 30–40% compared with pre-2022 procedures [[MOH Vietnam, 2024](https://moh.gov.vn)].  

This change directly benefits companies importing APIs or finished drugs, especially smaller firms that previously faced long lead times due to paperwork and in-person review.

### 3. Revised Clinical Trial and Pharmacovigilance Rules

Vietnam’s MOH also updated its regulations for clinical research and post-market safety monitoring. The **Circular No. 37/2023/TT-BYT** (amending 45/2017) outlines clearer requirements for pharmacovigilance reporting, mandating that manufacturers and distributors establish active safety-monitoring systems and submit annual safety update reports (ASURs).  

These rules enhance transparency and align Vietnam’s drug-safety ecosystem with the International Council for Harmonisation (ICH) standards [[WHO Vietnam, 2024](https://www.who.int/vietnam)].  

### 4. Local Content and Technology Transfer Requirements

Under the **National Pharmaceutical Industry Development Strategy 2021–2030 (Decision 1165/QĐ-TTg)**, the government promotes local production of essential medicines and APIs. Recent MOH guidelines encourage joint ventures between domestic firms and international API producers to facilitate technology transfer and capacity-building.  

By 2030, Vietnam aims to locally produce 60% of total pharmaceutical demand and 70% of essential medicines [[FIA Vietnam, 2024](https://fia.mpi.gov.vn)].  

### 5. Environmental and Green Manufacturing Standards

Reflecting global ESG trends, the MOH and Ministry of Natural Resources & Environment issued new guidance integrating green chemistry and sustainable waste management into GMP audits. Factories must now track solvent usage and emission data to maintain certification [[UNIDO, 2024](https://www.unido.org)].  

## How the Guidelines Impact Pharmaceutical Manufacturers

The new MOH regulations bring both opportunities and operational challenges. Below are key areas of impact.

### 1. Compliance Costs and Capital Investment

Upgrading production facilities to meet PIC/S-GMP or EU-GMP standards can cost US $2–5 million per plant, depending on size and technology [[VIR, 2024](https://vir.com.vn/pharma-to-experience-robust-growth-114808.html)]. While this is a steep requirement for smaller domestic firms, compliance opens doors to public tenders and export markets across ASEAN and the EU.  

The government offers tax incentives and preferential loans via the Vietnam Development Bank to partially offset these costs, especially for companies investing in clean technology or local API production [[MOIT, 2024](https://moit.gov.vn)].  

### 2. Operational Transparency and Digital Readiness

Digitalization under the new e-licensing system demands better data management and cybersecurity readiness. Manufacturers must ensure that quality documentation, validation records, and safety data are stored securely and retrievable on demand.  

Companies adopting ERP and quality-management systems (QMS) are already reporting shorter audit cycles and faster market approvals.

### 3. Supply Chain and Sourcing Adjustments

Stricter import documentation and supplier audits now require firms to maintain traceable API sourcing. Manufacturers must confirm that imported APIs come from GMP-certified plants and provide Certificates of Suitability (CEP) when applicable.  

This has encouraged a wave of long-term partnerships between Vietnamese firms and Indian or South Korean suppliers to ensure continuity and compliance. Some local firms, such as Imexpharm and Traphaco, have already signed technology-transfer agreements to localize parts of API synthesis.

### 4. Increased Regulatory Predictability

While the reforms raise compliance demands, they also increase transparency and reduce procedural uncertainty. Consistent timelines for drug-license renewals and standardized GMP inspections help investors forecast operational risk more accurately — a key factor for foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows.

### 5. Competitive Advantage Through Quality

Companies that achieve EU-GMP or PIC/S-GMP certification gain a significant competitive edge. They can export to higher-value markets and participate in international tenders. As of 2024, Vietnam had seven factories certified to EU-GMP standards, with more expected to qualify by 2026 [[Vietnam News, 2024](https://vietnamnews.vn/economy/1656408/pharmaceutical-industry-sees-slowing-growth-momentum.html)].

## Industry Response: Case Studies and Adaptation

### 1. DHG Pharma and Taisho Pharmaceutical

DHG Pharma, now majority-owned by Japan’s Taisho Pharmaceutical, has implemented comprehensive QMS digitalization in anticipation of Vietnam’s regulatory tightening. The company’s Can Tho facility achieved full PIC/S-GMP alignment in 2024, reducing inspection downtime by 20%.  

### 2. Imexpharm’s EU-GMP Ambitions

Imexpharm invested over US $10 million to upgrade its Dong Thap and Binh Duong factories, both of which achieved EU-GMP status in 2023. The company now serves as a contract manufacturer for European generics firms, exemplifying how Vietnamese players can leverage regulation to move up the value chain [[VIR, 2023](https://vir.com.vn)].  

### 3. Traphaco’s Sustainable Manufacturing

Traphaco has adopted a “green GMP” model, introducing solvent-recycling systems and waste-neutralization processes that comply with MOH environmental standards. The model has cut water use by 30% and earned recognition under the UNIDO Green Pharma Initiative 2024.  

## Challenges Ahead

Despite clear progress, several obstacles remain.

1. **Fragmented industry structure:** Over half of Vietnamese manufacturers operate on small or medium scale, making capital upgrades difficult.  
2. **Human-resource constraints:** A shortage of experienced regulatory-affairs specialists slows compliance adoption.  
3. **Complex approval layering:** Companies must still coordinate among multiple agencies — MOH, MOIT, MONRE — for full certification.  
4. **Slow API localization:** Even with incentives, local API output meets less than 15% of demand; scaling up remains a long-term task.  
5. **Post-market surveillance gaps:** Pharmacovigilance systems are improving but remain under-resourced in smaller firms.  

## Opportunities Emerging from Regulatory Reform

While challenges persist, the reforms open new growth channels:

- **Export potential:** EU-GMP certification positions Vietnam as a credible contract-manufacturing destination.  
- **Investment attraction:** Regulatory transparency has already spurred renewed interest from Japan, South Korea, and Singapore in Vietnam’s pharma sector [[FIA, 2024](https://fia.mpi.gov.vn)].  
- **Innovation partnerships:** Incentives for R&D and API synthesis pave the way for joint research ventures between academia and private firms.  
- **Regional integration:** Compliance with ASEAN Common Technical Dossier (ACTD) requirements enables easier cross-border product registration within ASEAN markets.  

## Preparing for the Next Phase of Compliance

Pharmaceutical companies can future-proof their operations through five key strategies:

1. **Invest Early in Digital Compliance Systems:** Integrate e-batch records, audit-ready documentation, and secure data storage.  
2. **Develop In-House Regulatory Expertise:** Build teams capable of interpreting and implementing evolving MOH rules.  
3. **Strengthen Supplier Qualification:** Adopt robust auditing and monitoring programs to ensure upstream compliance.  
4. **Engage with Regulators Proactively:** Participate in MOH consultation sessions to stay ahead of new circulars.  
5. **Adopt ESG Frameworks:** Position the brand for global partnerships by aligning with sustainable manufacturing initiatives.  

## Conclusion

Vietnam’s new MOH guidelines represent a pivotal step toward modernizing its pharmaceutical manufacturing base. Though compliance costs are rising, the reforms enhance transparency, safety, and global competitiveness — laying the foundation for Vietnam’s transition from a generic-focused market to a quality-driven manufacturing hub.

For local and international investors alike, the key lies in adaptation: embracing digitalization, strengthening quality culture, and leveraging incentives for innovation and sustainability.  

As regulatory convergence continues and domestic capabilities mature, Vietnam’s pharmaceutical industry is on track to become a major production and export hub in Southeast Asia — built on the principles of quality, compliance, and long-term resilience.
