## Introduction

Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (APIs) are the backbone of the global pharmaceutical industry — the essential building blocks that determine the efficacy and safety of medicines. For Vietnam, a fast-growing pharmaceutical market in Southeast Asia, sourcing high-quality APIs has become a strategic issue that directly impacts the country’s manufacturing capacity, drug pricing, and competitiveness.

While Vietnam’s domestic pharmaceutical manufacturing industry has grown impressively in recent years, the country still imports up to **90% of its APIs**, mainly from **China and India**. This dependency exposes local manufacturers to external risks — from fluctuating prices to global supply chain shocks. As Vietnam aims to localize more of its production and reduce reliance on imports, understanding the challenges and exploring practical sourcing strategies has never been more critical.

This article takes a deep dive into the challenges Vietnamese pharma companies face in sourcing APIs — from regulatory barriers to quality assurance and logistics — and outlines potential solutions and innovations shaping the future of API sourcing in the country.

## The Role of APIs in Pharma Manufacturing in Vietnam

APIs are the biologically active ingredients that make medicines work. They are at the heart of drug formulation and define the therapeutic outcomes. Without a consistent and high-quality API supply, pharmaceutical manufacturers face delays, production bottlenecks, and compromised product standards.

In Vietnam, the pharmaceutical industry contributes significantly to the healthcare sector’s modernization. The market has been expanding steadily, driven by rising healthcare spending, population growth, and government support for domestic production. According to recent industry estimates, **Vietnam’s pharmaceutical market exceeded USD 7 billion in 2023**, with expectations to reach **USD 10 billion by 2030**.

However, this growth is coupled with a persistent reliance on imported APIs. Despite having over 250 licensed pharmaceutical manufacturers, only a handful produce APIs locally — and mostly for basic or generic drugs. High-tech APIs for complex therapeutic categories, such as oncology or biologics, still come from overseas.

## Challenges in Sourcing APIs for Vietnam

### 1. Regulatory and Compliance Hurdles

The pharmaceutical sector is among the most tightly regulated industries in Vietnam. Importing APIs requires compliance with multiple layers of local and international standards, including **Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP)**, **Certificate of Pharmaceutical Product (CPP)**, and approvals from the **Drug Administration of Vietnam (DAV)** under the Ministry of Health.

The complexity of these procedures — from dossier submissions to import licensing — often leads to delays. Frequent updates to regulations, language barriers in documentation, and differences in testing protocols can further slow down approval timelines. For smaller manufacturers, these administrative challenges can be overwhelming, especially when compared to larger multinational corporations with dedicated compliance teams.

### 2. Quality Control and Assurance Concerns

Ensuring API quality is non-negotiable. Substandard or adulterated APIs can lead to product recalls, reputational damage, or even patient harm. Yet, in practice, verifying supplier quality remains a challenge.

Some suppliers — particularly from regions with less stringent enforcement — may provide incomplete documentation or inconsistent certificates of analysis. For Vietnamese importers, the lack of local laboratories equipped for advanced molecular testing and certification adds another layer of difficulty. As a result, many manufacturers rely on **trust-based relationships** or external audits, which are costly and time-consuming.

### 3. Supply Chain Disruptions and Logistics Challenges

The global supply chain shocks triggered by the **COVID-19 pandemic**, followed by shipping delays and geopolitical tensions, exposed just how fragile the pharmaceutical supply network can be. In Vietnam, API imports have been affected by prolonged customs clearance times, limited cold chain logistics, and fluctuating freight costs.

Even minor disruptions can cascade through the manufacturing process — delaying production schedules and inflating costs. Many Vietnamese companies have had to increase their safety stock levels, which ties up working capital and strains storage capacity.

### 4. Cost Factors and Pricing Volatility

API prices are highly sensitive to changes in raw material availability, environmental regulations in producing countries, and energy costs. In 2022 and 2023, for example, API prices from China surged due to stricter environmental inspections and temporary factory shutdowns. These fluctuations directly impact Vietnam’s cost of goods, especially for generics manufacturers operating on thin margins.

In addition, currency fluctuations and import tariffs contribute to unstable input costs. Local manufacturers often find it difficult to adjust pricing in time to reflect these changes, which can hurt profitability.

### 5. Limited Local API Production Capacity

Despite government ambitions to develop domestic API manufacturing, Vietnam’s current production remains small-scale and fragmented. The sector faces hurdles such as high capital investment requirements, lack of advanced chemical synthesis technology, limited R&D infrastructure, and challenges in meeting international quality standards.

A 2024 report by the **Vietnam Pharmaceutical Companies Association (VNPCA)** noted that fewer than **10% of domestic manufacturers produce APIs**, mostly targeting common antibiotics, vitamins, and analgesics. Complex APIs, such as cardiovascular drugs or antiretrovirals, are still largely imported.

### 6. Supplier Certification and Traceability Issues

Traceability remains a critical gap in Vietnam’s API supply chain. Some suppliers, especially intermediaries, may not be transparent about the true origin of their APIs. This complicates compliance verification and increases the risk of counterfeit or low-quality inputs entering the market. Strengthening traceability mechanisms — such as digital supplier registries or blockchain-enabled tracking — could help mitigate this risk.

## Practical Solutions and Strategic Approaches

### 1. Strengthening Regulatory Capabilities

Pharma companies need to build strong internal regulatory teams that stay informed about evolving local and international requirements. Engaging early with the Ministry of Health, attending regulatory workshops, and maintaining updated documentation can significantly shorten approval cycles.

Collaborating with regulatory consultants or local agents experienced in import licensing can also help smaller companies navigate bureaucratic complexity. Proactive compliance not only reduces delays but also enhances credibility with global partners.

### 2. Building Long-Term Partnerships with Reliable Suppliers

Instead of relying on transactional imports, Vietnamese manufacturers can benefit from **strategic partnerships** with reputable API producers. Long-term contracts, joint ventures, or technology transfer agreements with suppliers in India, South Korea, and the EU can provide better price stability and quality assurance.

Some local firms are already adopting this model — partnering with Indian manufacturers for raw material sourcing and technology licensing, ensuring greater control over quality and supply continuity.

### 3. Diversifying the Supplier Base and Logistics Channels

Diversification is key to reducing dependency. Expanding sourcing networks beyond China and India to include **ASEAN partners**, **Europe**, or **Japan** can mitigate geopolitical and trade-related risks. Similarly, adopting multiple shipping routes or establishing bonded warehouses near industrial zones can cushion against logistics disruptions.

Vietnam’s government has also introduced incentives for logistics infrastructure, such as the development of **pharmaceutical industrial parks** in provinces like Binh Duong and Bac Ninh, which include temperature-controlled storage and customs facilitation zones.

### 4. Leveraging Technology and Digital Procurement Tools

Digitalization is transforming the procurement landscape. Platforms integrating **AI-driven supplier evaluation**, **e-procurement**, and **real-time inventory tracking** are helping manufacturers make data-informed sourcing decisions. These tools enhance transparency, reduce manual errors, and allow for better forecasting of API needs.

Some companies are experimenting with blockchain-based traceability systems that track APIs from production to shipment — ensuring authenticity and minimizing counterfeit risks.

### 5. Government Support and Policy Initiatives

The Vietnamese government recognizes API self-sufficiency as a strategic priority. Under the **National Strategy for the Development of Vietnam’s Pharmaceutical Industry to 2030 (with a vision to 2045)**, incentives are being offered for local API producers, including tax breaks, land use support, and preferential loans for R&D.

Collaborations with international organizations such as the **World Health Organization (WHO)** and **Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA)** are also underway to improve GMP compliance and technology transfer.

### 6. Enhancing Quality Assurance Systems

Manufacturers can mitigate risks by establishing in-house testing labs or partnering with accredited third-party laboratories for quality verification. Implementing **supplier audit programs** and adopting **ISO 17025** testing standards can further strengthen quality control.

Creating a shared national database of certified API suppliers — potentially coordinated by the DAV — would also enhance transparency and reduce duplication of audits.

## Case Examples: Success Through Strategy

Several Vietnamese companies are already demonstrating that proactive strategies yield tangible results.

* **Traphaco**, a leading domestic manufacturer, has strengthened its supplier auditing framework and implemented digital procurement solutions to improve traceability and supplier performance evaluation.
* **DHG Pharma** has pursued technology transfer partnerships with Japanese and South Korean firms, improving both the quality and consistency of imported APIs.
* **Imexpharm**, another major player, has invested in automation and predictive inventory systems, enabling better control over sourcing costs and delivery timelines.

Beyond these large players, smaller pharmaceutical firms are also finding creative ways to adapt. **Mediplantex**, for example, has established direct relationships with certified API manufacturers in India to reduce dependency on middlemen, lowering procurement costs by nearly 10%. Meanwhile, **Stada Vietnam** has implemented hybrid sourcing — combining regional suppliers for generic APIs with EU-certified sources for high-value formulations — balancing quality and cost.

Industry collaboration is also becoming more visible. In 2024, several companies in Ho Chi Minh City formed an API sourcing consortium aimed at sharing supplier data, negotiating better import terms, and collectively auditing overseas manufacturers. This cooperative model allows smaller firms to leverage collective bargaining power while enhancing transparency and regulatory compliance.

These initiatives underscore a growing maturity in Vietnam’s pharmaceutical ecosystem — one that values collaboration, technology adoption, and long-term sustainability over short-term cost savings.

## Future Outlook

The outlook for API sourcing in Vietnam is cautiously optimistic. The combination of government incentives, growing private sector investment, and increasing regional collaboration within ASEAN is setting the stage for the gradual localization of API production.

In the next decade, Vietnam could emerge as a secondary API production hub in Southeast Asia, focusing initially on high-demand therapeutic classes such as antibiotics, analgesics, and cardiovascular drugs. As domestic R&D capabilities mature and environmental standards improve, more complex APIs may follow.

At the same time, the adoption of digital procurement systems and regional trade agreements — such as the RCEP (Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership) — will further streamline cross-border sourcing and certification harmonization.

## Conclusion

Sourcing APIs effectively is not just a procurement exercise — it’s a strategic function that determines the sustainability and competitiveness of Vietnam’s pharmaceutical industry. By addressing regulatory complexity, enhancing supplier relationships, investing in technology, and encouraging local API production, Vietnam can gradually reduce its dependency on imports while ensuring high-quality, affordable medicines for its population.

As the country continues to evolve into a regional pharma hub, the ability to secure reliable and transparent API supply chains will be central to its success.
