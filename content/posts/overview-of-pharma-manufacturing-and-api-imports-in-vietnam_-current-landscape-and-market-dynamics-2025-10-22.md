## Introduction

Pharmaceutical manufacturing is a cornerstone of modern healthcare systems, transforming raw materials into life-saving medicines that improve global health outcomes. Central to this complex process is the Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient (API) — the key component that delivers a drug’s therapeutic effect. Without reliable access to high-quality APIs, production can stall, risking medicine shortages and patient safety.

Vietnam, with its fast-growing economy and expanding healthcare sector, is emerging as a significant player in the Southeast Asian pharmaceutical landscape. Over the past decade, rapid industrial growth has been driven by rising domestic demand, increased healthcare awareness, and supportive government policies. Yet despite this progress, Vietnam remains heavily reliant on imported APIs, a dependency that highlights both opportunity and vulnerability in its pharma supply chain.

Importing APIs requires navigating strict regulatory frameworks, managing cross-border logistics, and ensuring rigorous quality controls — all of which influence the reliability of Vietnam’s drug manufacturing. The COVID-19 pandemic and global trade disruptions further exposed fragilities in supply chains, underscoring the need for resilient sourcing strategies and stronger local production capacity.

This post examines Vietnam’s pharmaceutical manufacturing and API import landscape, covering market conditions, policy direction, regulatory frameworks, and key challenges. Understanding these factors helps businesses, investors, and policymakers make informed decisions as Vietnam moves toward becoming a more self-reliant and innovative pharma hub.

## Overview of Pharma Manufacturing in Vietnam

Vietnam’s pharmaceutical manufacturing sector continues to expand, supported by favorable demographics and sustained economic growth. The country hosts over 200 GMP-certified pharmaceutical manufacturers — ranging from multinational corporations to domestic enterprises producing generics, OTC medicines, and limited local APIs.[^1]

### Current Industry Landscape

The sector is dominated by generic drug production, reflecting government efforts to promote affordable healthcare. Leading domestic companies include DHG Pharma, Traphaco, and Imexpharm, each recognized for strong GMP compliance and regional market reach.  
Foreign direct investment (FDI) is also increasing, with international firms establishing local facilities or joint ventures to tap Vietnam’s growing market.

### Government Policies and Support

Vietnam’s leadership recognizes the pharmaceutical industry as a strategic secto*. Earlier frameworks such as the *Vietnam Pharmaceutical Industry Development Strategy 2020–2025* have now been reinforced by the *National Strategy for Developing Vietnam’s Pharmaceutical Industry to 2030, with a Vision to 2045 (Decision No.1165/QĐ-TTg, issued October 2023)*.[^2]  
This plan seeks to enhance domestic drug production, upgrade GMP standards, and reduce dependence on imported materials through investment incentives, tax benefits, and R&D support.

### Infrastructure and Technology Advancements

Industrial zones in Ho Chi Minh City, Hanoi, and Da Nang now host increasingly modernized facilities, incorporating automation and digitalized quality control. Technology-transfer partnerships and training initiatives are improving productivity and regulatory compliance, helping Vietnam strengthen its position within ASEAN’s pharmaceutical supply network.

Despite these improvements, local production of complex APIs remains limited, hindered by high capital requirements, technical constraints, and shortages of skilled chemists and regulatory experts.[^3]

## Role and Importance of API Imports in Vietnam

### What Are APIs?

APIs are the biologically active or chemically synthesized substances responsible for a drug’s therapeutic action. Every API must meet stringent purity and consistency standards to ensure safety and efficacy.

### Vietnam’s API Import Dependency

Vietnam currently imports roughly 80–90% of its APIs, depending on product category and reporting year.[^4] Only a small number of domestic factories produce simple APIs for local use.  
Most APIs are sourced from China and India, the world’s largest API exporters, due to their scale, cost efficiency, and established chemical manufacturing ecosystems. Smaller volumes of high-value or specialty APIs arrive from Europe, Japan, and the United States.

### Implications of Import Reliance

While imports give Vietnam access to a wide range of raw materials, this dependence poses several risks:

- **Supply Chain Vulnerability:** Disruptions in supplier countries — from geopolitical tensions, trade barriers, or pandemics — can trigger shortages.  
- **Quality Assurance:** Ensuring consistent API quality across multiple foreign suppliers requires rigorous audits and testing by importers and regulators.  
- **Price Sensitivity:** Changes in freight costs, tariffs, or supplier pricing directly affect manufacturing margins and drug affordability.

### Efforts Toward Local API Production

Recognizing these risks, policymakers are promoting domestic API production through R&D funding, investment incentives, and public-private partnerships focused on chemical synthesis and biopharma capabilities. However, significant technical and financial hurdles remain, making self-sufficiency a long-term goal rather than an immediate reality.

## Market Dynamics Affecting Pharma Manufacturing and API Imports

### Growing Domestic Pharmaceutical Demand

Vietnam’s expanding middle class, universal health insurance coverage, and aging population are driving consistent growth in pharmaceutical demand.  
Industry estimates place market growth at around 8–12% annually in recent years, with continued upward momentum expected through 2030.[^5] Chronic disease prevalence and greater access to healthcare services continue to propel consumption and investment.

### Supply Chain and Logistics Challenges

API imports face ongoing logistical hurdles despite infrastructure improvements:

- **Customs Delays:** Complex documentation and inconsistent inspection timelines can affect delivery schedules.  
- **Transportation Risk:** Temperature-sensitive APIs require reliable cold-chain systems, which remain underdeveloped in certain regions.  
- **Inventory Pressure:** Balancing just-in-time procurement with supply-disruption risk complicates production planning.

### Regulatory Compliance and Quality Assurance

Vietnam’s Drug Administration of Vietnam (DAV) enforces strict quality requirements for both locally produced and imported APIs. Importers must present Certificates of Analysis, conduct supplier audits, and manage substandard batch recalls or destruction.  
While GMP enforcement has strengthened, compliance costs can be burdensome for smaller manufacturers.[^6]

### Impact of Global Supply Chain Disruptions

The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted global pharmaceutical vulnerabilities, causing temporary API shortages and cost increases. This experience has accelerated discussions on supply diversification, strategic stockpiling, and local API capacity development within Vietnam’s policy agenda.

## Regulatory Environment for API Imports

API importation is governed by Vietnam’s Ministry of Health through the *Drug Administration of Vietnam (DAV)*, which manages registration, import licensing, and quality inspections.

### Registration and Approval Process

APIs must be registered before import, requiring detailed dossiers outlining manufacturing processes, GMP certificates, and product specifications.  
The DAV also conducts overseas audits of API producers to ensure GMP compliance prior to approval.

### Alignment with International Standards

Vietnam continues aligning with *WHO* and *ICH* guidelines, a move that enhances trade compatibility and international credibility for Vietnamese pharmaceutical exports.

### Recent Regulatory Updates

Reforms under the 2030 national strategy emphasize digitalization of administrative procedures, risk-based inspection systems, and transparent electronic dossier submission — all designed to expedite legitimate imports while maintaining safety standards.[^7]
